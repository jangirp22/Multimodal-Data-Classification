# Multimodal-Data-Classification
This project focuses on binary classification of emoticon sequences using multimodal data. The dataset is processed in feature-based, sequential, and reduced-dimensionality forms. Three models are compared: two LightGBM classifiers and one LSTM model. PCA is used to reduce dimensionality and enhance classification accuracy.
